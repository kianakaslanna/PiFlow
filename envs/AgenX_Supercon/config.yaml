        # Superconductor Critical Temperature Prediction

        This model predicts the critical temperature (Tc) of superconducting materials based on their chemical composition.

        ## Input:
        - Chemical formula in standard notation (e.g., "Ba0.2La1.8Cu1O4-Y")
        - Optional structure type (e.g., "T" for tetragonal)

        ## Output:
        - Predicted critical temperature in Kelvin

        ## Scientific Background:
        Superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon characterized by zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields that occurs in certain materials when cooled below a critical temperature (Tc). Materials with higher Tc values are particularly valuable for practical applications as they require less extreme cooling.

        Key families of superconductors include:
        - Conventional superconductors (metals and alloys)
        - Copper-oxide based high-temperature superconductors
        - Iron-based superconductors
        - Heavy fermion superconductors
        - Organic superconductors

        This tool enables virtual experimentation to explore how compositional variations affect the critical temperature.
